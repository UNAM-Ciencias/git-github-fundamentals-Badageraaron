###The Basics of GitHub Course

Just finished the course, i already had knowledge on some of the concepts but i realized i overlooked the proflie README feature, so i tried it out. I found the resources helpful to refresh my memory on some of the concepts i was already somewhat familiar with and i found their writing and formatting syntax page helpful whan i created my profile README.
